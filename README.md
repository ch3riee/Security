## SETUP
### 1. Download this github repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ch3riee/Security.git .
```
### 2. Inside of the project folder, run command for Docker-Compose to start up the gateway/server
```
docker-compose up
```
### 3. Example Rest Endpoint 
To check if working, go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/hello </br>
This should bounce you automatically to the login page at: http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/login </br>
## Deploying Your Third Party Microservice and Using  Shared SessionStore
### 1. Add Microservice to Docker-Compose
Please read the following documentation at https://docs.docker.com/compose/ to learn about docker-compose. </br>
In order to add your microservice to the api gateway, a separate container for your microservice must be added to the
docker-compose file located in the downloaded project folder. Please use the existing containers as examples if needed. </br>
#### Public Key Volume Mount Requirement
For every microservice Docker container added to docker-compose, you must mount the shared public key folder as a volume. 
This volume can be copied from the volume in docker container srv-java-users. It allows the microservice to have access to the public key, in order to decrypt JWT token generated by this service. </br>
```
volumes:
  - ./src/main/resources/pki/Public.key:/var/lib/pki-public
```
#### Depends-On Requirement
Please add your container name to the depends_on section of the web container (nginx container). 

### 2. Adding Microservices to NGINX site.conf.template
Within the project folder, locate **./settings/nginx/conf.d/site.conf.template**This file holds the NGINX configuration that is copied into default.conf by the NGINX container at command docker-compose up. Each microservice must be added to this configuration in order for them to be deployed along with the existing API gateway. </br>
#### Section: WEB
This commented section in the NGINX configuration is where any web applications (microservices) meant for web users is placed. There is already a sample web application within this section. Any microservice added to this section must have the 
```
#Web Section
if ($http_cookie !~ "JwtToken=")
{
  return 301 $scheme://$host:8080/rest/login ;
}
```
check in order to authenticate/authorize users that will be accessing these endpoints. If this JwtToken does not exist in the
user's request header, NGINX should proxy redirect to the login endpoint.
#### Section: INTERNAL
This commented section in the NGINX configuration is where any APIS for microservices should be placed. For example currently the Session get/set api for microservices is housed in this section. All endpoints in this section should check to see if an authorization header exists. The actual bearer token will be checked/validated within any of the APIs themselves. If the bearer token header does not exist, return 403 Forbidden Status.
```
#Internal Section
if($Http_authorization= ""){
   return 403;
}
```
#### Section: STATIC
  This commented section in the NGINX configuration is where static content location blocks should be placed. For more information regarding configuring static content, please go to </br>
https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/serving-static-content/ </br>
  When serving static content, a root or alias path must be set in the location block. If you would like to use the current static folder to serve your content, without altering any docker-compose volume mounts, please place all static content within the /resources/static folder in the project folder. This will be mapped to /var/lib/static/ within the NGINX docker container. </br>
  **NOTE**: If static content is placed somewhere else, please set this as a volume mount within the NGINX docker container in docker-compose file. The path within the docker container itself is the one that should be passed as the alias or root. </br>
EXAMPLE: Looks for /var/lib/static/index.html file and serves the content
```
#Static Section
location /static/ {
    alias /var/lib/static/ ;
    index index.html ;
}
```
### 3. Get Service Account Token
**NOTE**: Please make sure your microservice has already been registered by an admin prior to this step!
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/services/getServiceToken?name=_______&tempSecret=______  </br>
  tempSecret may be left out initially from the query param. However the name of the microservice is required (name you registered), to make sure you retrieve the right JWT token. <br/>
  If tempSecret is left out, you will receive the tempSecret string that has been encrypted with the public key (that you registered). <br/>
  In order to get the actual JWT token for your service account, you must decrypt the tempSecret string with your own private key (from the public key/private key pair) and call this API endpoint again with the decrypted string passed in tempSecret query param. If this tempSecret matches the one given, you will receive the JWT token inside of the Response body within a JSON object. </br>
### 4. Use Service Account Token
  Grab the JWT token from the JSON object you received from http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/services/getServiceToken and place this into every request header for your microservice. <br/>
Header name: authorization  
Header content: Bearer [place jwt token here after a single white space]  
**This token is required in order to use any of the Service APIS, such as the Session Get/Set API </br>
### 5. Utilizing Shared SessionStore
The true benefit of using this API gateway, is that a session store and user store is already available to be used by all microservices deployed with it. This eliminates the problem of having to create/manage a session store within your microservice.
#### Using Provided Login/ Logout
If you have properly configured your microservice within NGINX and Docker, any request to your registered endpoints will bounce unauthenticated users to the shared Login page provided by the API gateway. </br>
There are three separate options for logging in. 
**Login: **
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/login </br>
1) Login Locally: First press the signup link to signup for an account. Then follow the directions onscreen to login.
2) Login SSO: Click on the github link to login via SSO through github. 
3) Login Guest: Option to continue as guest role is available, note that any user information will not be saved. However
you will still receive a session and JWT token like the other login options. </br>
**Logout: ** 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/logout </br>
After your users have logged in, they will be provided a session along with a JWTtoken saved within Cookie "JwtToken". 
**As the microservice, you must decrypt the JwtToken provided in EACH request by using the shared Public Key (mounted in Docker).** </br>
##### Example Kotlin Code For Decrypting JWT Token
cookie passed in parseClaimsJws(cookie) is the actual JwtToken cookie provided by the login action explained above.
```
 var publicKey = (this::class.java.classLoader).getResource("pki/Public.key").readText().toByteArray()
        publicKey = Base64.getDecoder().decode(publicKey)
        val res = Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(RSAPublicKeyImpl(publicKey)).parseClaimsJws(cookie).body
        return Response.status(Status.OK).entity(res).build()
```        
If you are able to successfully decrypt the token with no exceptions, than this means that the user has been authenticated 
and should be allowed into your service.
#### Accessing SessionStore (Session API)
In order to get/set into a specific user's session, you must have a reference to the user's session id that is passed into
the Session API.
**MUST HAVE SERVICE ACCOUNT TOKEN AS [authorization: Bearer nfjfkjbfkjbefkjebf] in header. You must also have sessionOperator role allowed inside of this token in order to get and set attributes inside of the session.**
##### Get Attributes from Session
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/session/get?key=________&id=_________ </br>
**key query param**: This param should be either the name of the attribute stored in the session, or the dotted notation json attribute path to the key you would like to retrieve. <br/>
**id query param**: This param is where you pass in the desired Session ID that you would like to get an attribute from. </br>
For example either myAttribute or myAttribute.a.b.c (the second will go into the attribute myAttribute and return the value of c). 

##### Set Attributes in Session
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/session/set?key=________&id=__________ </br>
**key query param**: Same as the get Attribute key query param. Except that it will create the json objects if they do not exist. <br/>
**id query param**: This param is where you pass in the desired Session ID that you would like to set attribute into.
EXAMPLE: A.B.C -> will store whatever json object/arrays you pass in the request body at attribute C, that is within json objects B and A. The attribute name stored in the session itself will be A. <br/>
**You can add/replace json objects but you can only replace json Arrays (cannot add elements into the array, will replace the whole thing)** </br>

## Admin Section
### Register Microservice 
Example  POST endpoint:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/services/register?name=_____ </br>
**The NAME query parameter**: Pass in the name that you desire the Microservice to be called.<br/>
**Request body**: Pass in the Microservice's own RSA public key (please generate your own public key/private key pair). <br/>
Your passed in Microservice's public key, will be used in order to encrypt a randomized tempSecret string. This is to make sure that any requests for the JWT Service Account token are only retrieved/used by the authorized Service Account. <br/>
### Role Crud API 
This API allows someone with an Admin role, to create new roles (will save in DB), delete roles, update existing roles with new permissions, or assign roles to specific service accounts or user accounts(identified by name).
#### CREATE ROLE
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/role/create?name=_______ </br>
**name query param**: Name of the new role you want to add. 
#### DELETE ROLE
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/role/delete?name=_______ </br>
**name query param**: Name of role you want to delete from DB.
#### ASSIGN ROLE
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/role/assign?rname=_______&name=______&type=______ </br>
**rname**: Role name to assign  <br/>
**name**: Either service account name or user's username <br/>
**type**: service or user. <br/> **Must put "service" to identify it is a service account. Else it will always look in user accounts.**
#### UPDATE ROLE
http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/role/update?name=_______ </br>
**name**: Role name to update permissions on. All previous permissions will be replaced for this role. <br/>
**Request body**: Please pass in a JSON array with the permission names. The whole array of permissions will be set to this role. <br/>
